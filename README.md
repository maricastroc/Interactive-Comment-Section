## üìö Project Description
This is a solution to the challenge [Interactive-Comment-Section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9)

In this project, I developed an application that simulates a page of posts and dynamic comment sections, with CRUD operations., with the following functionalities:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create new posts
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments

**The resolution to this challenge has been modified**. Initially, the project solely requested the creation of comments and replies. However, I enhanced my solution by incorporating the Post component, thereby imbuing the project with a greater resemblance to a genuine application.


## üìå What did I learn?

In this project, I had the opportunity to practice working with ReactJS, using concepts like states, contenxts, lists, immutability, properties, components and keys.

I was able to work with React Primitive through the radix-ui library, which provided increased flexibility, reusability, and accessibility for the dialog component used. I also tried to use componentization as much as possible and used TypeScript to better organize the project and prevent bugs.
